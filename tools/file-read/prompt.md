## File Read Tool

You can read files and list directories using `file-read_read` and `file-read_list`.

- Use `read` to view file contents. Supports text files with configurable encoding.
- Use `list` to see directory contents (files and subdirectories).
- Use `maxLines` to limit output for large files.
- Paths can be absolute or relative to the server working directory.

# README (framework-specific rules)

### Purpose
- The README should answer the core questions quickly:
  - What is this project?
  - Why does it exist?
  - How do I run it?
  - Where do I go next?
- Keep it concise and scannable; avoid turning the README into full documentation.

### Structure (preferred order)
- Project name and short description
- Key features or capabilities (brief bullet list)
- Quick start (minimal steps to run locally)
- Requirements / prerequisites
- Basic usage examples (if applicable)
- Links to detailed docs (docs folder, website, etc.)

### Quick Start Focus
- Optimize for **time-to-first-success**.
- Provide the minimal working commands only.
- Avoid optional steps, advanced configuration, or deep explanations in this section.

### Linking Strategy
- Treat the README as a hub, not a full manual.
- Link to:
  - detailed setup/configuration
  - architecture or developer docs
  - contribution guidelines
- Avoid duplicating content that exists elsewhere.

### Code & Commands
- Ensure commands are copy-pasteable and realistic.
- Specify environment assumptions only when necessary.
- Use language-tagged code blocks.

### Length Discipline
- Keep the README relatively short.
- Move advanced topics (deployment, architecture, deep configuration) to dedicated docs.

### Project Signals
- Include only meaningful badges (build status, version, etc.) if the project already uses them.
- Avoid clutter from unnecessary badges or marketing content.

### Maintenance
- Keep instructions aligned with current project structure and scripts.
- Remove outdated sections rather than adding warnings.
- Update Quick Start whenever setup steps change.

### Audience Awareness
- Write for first-time users and contributors.
- Avoid internal-only context unless the repository is explicitly private/internal.

### Consistency
- Match the repository's tone and formatting style.
- Do not introduce a new documentation structure; link to existing docs locations instead.
